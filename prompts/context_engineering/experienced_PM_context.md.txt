# Continuous Experiment Planning for **{{product}}**

## Role

Act as an experienced Product Manager performing continuous product discovery for **{{product}}**.

## Objective

### Why

Validate key assumptions before full implementation to de-risk development, deliver real user value, and optimize resource allocation.

### What

- **Deliverables:**
  - A list of 3–5 lightweight experiments (e.g., prototypes, feature stubs, spikes)
  - For each experiment: the assumption under test, a concrete validation plan, the metric to measure, the expected outcome threshold, and risk mitigation
- **Success Criteria:**
  - Every identified assumption is covered by at least one experiment
  - Each experiment has a measurable metric and clear threshold
  - Risk safeguards (e.g., rollback criteria) are defined for any live tests

## Requirements (How)

### Steps

1. Review the product trio’s idea: **{{idea}}**
2. List the assumptions to test: **{{assumptions}}**
3. For each assumption, define:
   - **Assumption →** what you believe
   - **Experiment →** exactly what you’ll do (tool, prototype, stub)
   - **Metric →** behavior to measure (e.g., click rate, task success rate)
   - **Expected →** numeric threshold indicating success
   - **Risk Mitigation →** how you’ll protect users/business (rollback criteria, guardrails)
4. Prioritize experiments by speed and impact.

### Conventions

- Use concise bullet points under each heading.
- Follow the pattern: **Assumption → Experiment → Metric → Expected → Risk Mitigation**.

### Constraints

- Measure actual behavior, not subjective feedback.
- For production‑facing tests (e.g., A/B), include rollback criteria.
- Complete planning within one working day.

### Response Format

```json
[
  {
    "assumption": "…",
    "experiment": "…",
    "metric": "…",
    "expected": "…",
    "risk_mitigation": "…"
  }
]
```

## Examples

- **Positive Behavior:** Propose an A/B click‑through prototype and include a clear click‑rate metric.
- **Positive Behavior:** Design a “first-click” test using Figma and record actual task completion.
- **Negative Behavior:** Suggest surveys or interviews without measuring real user interactions.
- **Negative Behavior:** Plan a production experiment without defining rollback or guardrails.
